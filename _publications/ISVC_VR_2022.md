## Abstract
Sport-related concussion (SRC) depends on sensory information from visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems. At the same time, the current clinical administration of Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) is subjective and deviates among administrators. Therefore, for the assessment and management of concussion detection, standardization is required to lower the risk of injury and increase the validation among clinicians. With the advancement of technology, virtual reality (VR) can be utilized to advance the standardization of the VOMS, increasing the accuracy of testing administration and decreasing overall false positive rates. In this paper, we experimented with multiple machine learning methods to detect SRC on VR-generated data using VOMS. In our observation, the data generated from VR for smooth pursuit (SP) and the Visual Motion Sensitivity (VMS) tests are highly reliable for concussion detection. Furthermore, we train and evaluate these models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings show these models can reach high true-positive-rates of around 99.9 percent of symptom provocation on the VR stimuli-based VOMS vs. current clinical manual VOMS.
