Work Experience
======

### Graduate Research Assistant - Prof. Alireza Tavakkoli
*University of Nevada, Reno* (Reno, NV)  
*January 2021 - Present*

- **Space-associated Neuroocular Syndrome (SANS)**
  - Developed a Super-resolution Transformer-based model for identifying SANS degenerative disease in astronauts. Funded by NASA Grant No. 80NSSC20K1831.
  - **Tools:** PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Monai, OpenCV.
  - **Codes:** [Swin-FSR](https://github.com/FarihaHossain/SwinFSR)

- **Adversarial Attack Detection and Mitigation**
  - Developed two novel generative adversarial networks for adversarial attack detection in ECG. Also, developed a Game theoretical strategy, implemented with a convolutional neural network to mitigate adversarial attack.
  - **Tools:** Tensorflow-keras, NumPy, Keras, OpenCV.
  - **Codes:** [ECG-Adv-GAN](https://github.com/FarihaHossain/ECG-Adv-GAN), [ECG-ATK-GAN](https://github.com/FarihaHossain/ECG-ATK-GAN)

- **Concussion Detection using Virtual Reality**
  - Collaborating with Neuromechanics Lab to develop a system using Virtual Reality that can detect concussions.
  - **Tools:** Tensorflow-keras, Numpy, Pandas.

- **2D and 3D Medical Image Segmentation**
  - Developed a novel Swin-Transformer-based architecture for benign and malignant breast micro-mass segmentation from MRI and Ultrasound images, achieving 3-4% improvement over the current state-of-the-art. Also, developed an attention-based Swin-Transformer with feature-similarity loss for 3D OCT fluid segmentation.
